## Welcome
I’m a fourth-year Medical and Biological Physics student at **McMaster University**, exploring how physics can help us understand complex biological systems. My work combines **computational modeling, image analysis, and machine learning** to study dynamic behaviors in living systems.

I’ve worked as a **biophysics research** assistant at McMaster, analyzing the motion of magnetotactic bacteria using single-particle tracking, image processing, and machine learning. I also worked as a **Biomedical Research co-op student** at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, where I developed Monte Carlo light transport models and worked with fluorescence imaging systems to study light-tissue interactions.

Outside of the lab, I’m passionate about indie game development, building small, experimental projects. You can see my personal projects here. I enjoy combining analytical rigor with creative problem-solving, whether that’s modeling bacteria, simulating light transport, or designing a game from scratch.
